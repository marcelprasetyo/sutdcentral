(title of the repo? sutd. begin with: humble villager's comments: "It is good to share things instead of hoarding knowledge to ourselves, instead of not caring about other people who are initially lost. Help each other, build a more collaborative community at SUTD. This repo is not to my credit. He who has freely given us everything good to be appreciated and used in this world, has taught us to freely give any and everything good for free. To the eternal God in Jesus Christ glory be forever.") <if we call it comment and not just put it there, it is personal. therefore ppl can't modify it, they must treat it sacrosanct. people will be triggered, but it's not a random sentence, the attribution to God is valid so long as the attribution to my github username is there, which demands redirection to the Source.>
